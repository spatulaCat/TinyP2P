<b><a name="tiny">What is TinyP2P?</a></b></br>
TinyP2P is an app that lets you share files and chat with friends.</br>
</br>
<b><a name="what">What do I need to run TinyP2P?</a></b></br>
TinyP2P doesn't require installation or account registration.</br>
All you need to run TinyP2P is the <a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html">Java Runtime Environment</a> and connection to a network. </br>

</br>
<b><a name="connect">How do I connect to a TinyNet?</a></b></br>
If you are the first person to start the TinyNet, select the <a href="#created">Create New TinyNet</a> button.</br>
If one of your peers has already started a TinyNet, select the <a href="#joined">Join TinyNet</a> button. </br>
<b><a href="#trouble">Click here if you are having problems connecting.</a></b></br>
</br>

<b><a name="created">I have created a new TinyNet, what now?</a></b></br>
When you have created your TinyNet, you will see your <a href="#Mnemonic">TinyP2P Mnemonic</a> and IP Address.</br>
A Mnemonic is a phrase made up of four words, that translates to your IP Address. </br>
Give either this phrase or your IP Address to a peer who wants to connect to your TinyNet.</br>
Once your peers have joined your TinyNet, it's time to <a href="#shared">start sharing!</a></br>
</br>

<b><a name="joined">How do I join a TinyNet?</a></b></br>
To join your peer's TinyNet, you need their <a href="#Mnemonic">Mnemonic</a> or IP Address. Your peer can check their <a href="#Mnemonic">Mnemonic</a> </br>
by clicking on the cat icon in the top right corner of the TinyP2P window. </br>
You can enter the Mnemonic of any peer who is connected to a TinyNet. It does not have to be </br>
the Mnemonic of the peer who created the TinyNet.</br></br>

If you are on the same home or office network as your peers, and are having trouble connecting, <a href="#nat">click here.</a> </br></br>
<b><a name="Mnemonic">What is a Mnemonic?</a></b></br>

TinyP2P connects you to your peers using IP Addresses.</br>
A Mnemonic is just a four-word alternative to your IP Address. </br>
Mnemonics let you communicate your IP Address to your peers more easily. </br>
Instead of telling them your IP, which may look something like 192.168.1.254,</br>
you can tell them your Mnemonic which may look something like "tip cup key dog."</br>
You can always use a literal IP Address instead of a Mnemonic if you like. </br>
</br>
<b><a name="check">How do I check my Mnemonic?</a></b></br>
Clicking on the cat icon in the top right corner of the window will bring up your Mnemonic.</br>
</br>


<b><a name="shared">Your shared folder</a></b></br>
The first step is to select a folder that you would like to share with your peers.</br>
<u>All the files and folders</u> within this folder will be available to other users to see and download.</br>
Make sure that there are no personal files inside the folder you select to share,</br> as well as all the folders inside the shared folder.</br>
You can change your shared folder at any time by selecting "Settings -> Change shared folder."</br>
You can view which files and folders are being shared by clicking on the "View my shared folder" button.</br>
</br>
<b><a name="Downloading">Downloading files</a></b></br>
Your online peers will appear on the left of the screen, with their chosen TinyP2P usernames.</br>
Click on a peer's username to view their shared folder. </br>
Double-click or right-click on a file that you want, to begin downloading it. </br>
</br>
<b><a name="Sending">Sending files</a></b></br>
If you are viewing your own shared folder and want to send a file to a peer, </br>
double-click or right-click on the file that you want to send and select "send file."</br>
Enter the username of the user that you want to send the file to.</br>
The user will be prompted to accept or reject your file.</br>
</br>
</br>



<b><a name="trouble">I can't connect to a TinyNet!</a></b></br>
<u><a name="firewall">1. Your firewall may be blocking connections</a></u>  </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure that your firewall is not blocking Java applications.  </br></br>
<u><a name="nat">2. You may be behind a Network Address Translator router</a></u>  </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are on the same home or office network as your peers, your router may be configured</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use two different IP Addresses: One for peers on your network, and one for people over the internet.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TinyP2P gives you both your <b>internal</b> and </b>external</b> Mnemonics.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use your <b>internal</b> Mnemonic to connect to peers <b>on your home or office network</b>.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use your <b>external</b> Mnemonic to connect to peers <b>over the internet</b>.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view both of your Mnemonics, click on the cat icon in the top right corner of the window. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your router isn't a NAT router, your internal and external Mnemonics will be the same. </br></br>
<u><a name="internet">3. Check your internet connection</a></u>  </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TinyP2P lets you connect to peers who are on the same Local network (LAN) as you, </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even when the internet is down. You need to provide your <b>internet Mnemonic</b> to connect to peers </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over LAN when there is no internet connection.  </br>
 </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br></br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br></br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br>
